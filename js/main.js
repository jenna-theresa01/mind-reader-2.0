Do I want to use vanilla js or do I want to use React to finish this project?
This is where I started with psuedocode during mind reader 1.0:
     Functions I might want to use
    - window.onload function
        - 
    - addEventListener for the next and reset buttons
        - oncuechange?? fires a TextTrack has changed the currently displaying cues 
        - "click event"
    - a function to switch between "pages" without refreshing the webpage and using a button 
        -toggle (hide/show) an element
    - onclick listener
